Car Sales Analysis in Norway using Power BI

 Problem Statement
The automobile industry generates large volumes of sales data across multiple
brands, models, and time periods. However, raw sales data alone does not
provide meaningful insights for business decision-making. There is a need to
analyze car sales data in Norway to understand brand performance, revenue
generation, market share, and sales trends over time.This project aims to
transform raw car sales data into an interactive and visually appealing
dashboard using Power BI, enabling stakeholders to quickly interpret key
metrics and make data-driven decisions.

 Aim of the Project
The main aim of this project is to analyze car sales in Norway and build an
interactive Power BI dashboard that provides insights into sales performance,
revenue, market share, and trends across different car brands and models.

 Objectives 
1. To analyze the units sold for each car brand.
2. To calculate the total revenue generated for each car model.
3. To identify the number of variants available for each car model.
4. To visualize the market value of each car brand using a bar chart.
5. To determine the top 5 car models (variants) for each brand based on
revenue.
6. To analyze and display the market share percentage of different brands.
7. To show the sales trend over time for each car model.
8. To present all insights through a single interactive Power BI dashboard.


 Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains the following key fields:
• Brand / Make – Name of the car manufacturer
• Model – Car model name
• Variant – Different variants of each model
• Units Sold – Number of cars sold
• Price – Price of each unit
• Revenue – Calculated using units sold × price
• Year – Year of sale

 Methodology
1. Data Collection- Car sales data related to Norway was collected in
structured format (CSV/Excel).
2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
  Removed duplicates
  Handled missing values
  Standardized brand and model names
  Created calculated columns for revenue
4. Data Modeling-Established relationships between tables (Brand, Model, Sales,
Date).Created necessary measures using DAX
5. Data Analysis
  Aggregated sales and revenue by brand and model
 Computed market share and top-performing models
6. Visualization- Created interactive visuals such as bar charts, pie charts,
KPI cards, and line charts


 Tools & Technologies Used
• Power BI Desktop
• Microsoft Excel / CSV
• Data Visualization Techniques

 Dashboard Features
• Interactive brand and model filters
• KPI cards for quick insights (Units Sold, Revenue, Variants)
• Dynamic visuals responding to slicer selections
• User-friendly layout and professional design

 Results & Insights
• Volkswagen and Toyota dominate the market in terms of sales volume
• Certain models generate significantly higher revenue despite fewer units
sold
• Sales peaked during specific years and declined afterward
• A small number of models contribute to a large portion of total revenue
(Pareto effect)

 Future Scope
The project can be enhanced further by:
1. Adding real-time sales data integration
2. Including forecasting and predictive analysis
3. Comparing Norway sales with other countries
4. Adding profit margin analysis
5. Integrating customer demographics and EV adoption trends
6. Publishing the dashboard to Power BI Service with role-based access

 Conclusion
This Power BI project successfully transforms raw car sales data into actionable
insights through interactive dashboards. It helps stakeholders understand market
dynamics, brand performance, and sales trends in Norway, enabling better
strategic planning and decision-making.
